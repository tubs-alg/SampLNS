Installation
=================

This package requires a valid license of the commercial MIP-solver
Gurobi. You can get a free license for academic purposes. These academic
licenses are fairly easy to obtain, as explained in `this
video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW6ma8rdZk8>`__:

1. Register an academic account.
2. Install Gurobi (very easy with Conda, you only need the tool
   ``grbgetkey``).
3. Use ``grbgetkey`` to set up a license on your computer. You may have
   to be within the university network for this to work.

After you got your license, move into the folder with ``setup.py`` and
run

.. code:: shell

   pip install .

This command should automatically install all dependencies and build the
package. The package contains native C++-code that is compiled during
installation. This requires a C++-compiler. On most systems, this should
be installed by default. If not, you can install it via

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt install build-essential  # Ubuntu
   sudo pacman -S base-devel         # Arch

If you donâ€™t have initial samples at hand you might want to generate
initial samples for SampLNS with FeatJAR. This requires you to install
Java version 11 or higher.

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk

Generally, the installation will take a while as it has to compile the
C++, but it should work out of the box. If you encounter any problems,
please open an issue. Unfortunately, the performance of native code is
bought with a more complex installation process, and it is difficult to
make it work on all systems. Windows systems are especially difficult to
support. We suggest using a Linux system.
