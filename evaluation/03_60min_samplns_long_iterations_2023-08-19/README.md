# Running SampLNS with 60min and 120s iterations.

_Created 2023-08-10 (DK)_

This experiment solves the benchmark instances with long runtime and long
iterations. The primary goal is to obtain better lower bounds.

This experiment also uses the original benchmark files, without added
XML-versions.

## Useful outputs for external analysis

- `./out/06_best_bounds.csv`: A table with the best bounds for each instance.
