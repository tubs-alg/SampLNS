# Baseline Algorithms

This folder contains the results of the baseline algorithms. They are produced by FeatureIDE. The results of FeatureIDE have to be placed in the folder "EXTERNAL_INPUT" and specified in "_conf.py".

Run `./00_check_data.ipynb` to check the consistency of the data.

Run `./01_extract_simplified_data.ipynb` to extract a nice table from the data, which is placed in `OUTPUT`.
