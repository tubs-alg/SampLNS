# Running SampLNS with 60min and 60s iterations.

_Created 2023-08-10 (DK)_

This experiment solves the benchmark instances with long runtime and short
iterations. The primary goal is to obtain better lower bounds.

## Useful outputs for external analysis

- `./out/06_best_bounds.csv`: A table with the best bounds for each instance.
