# EXTERNAL_INPUT

The `EXTERNAL_INPUT` folder serves as a folder for external input files required for the execution of experiments or evaluations.
These files could be generated by code within the same project or originate from other projects, maybe even drafted by hand. 
The folder's purpose is to provide a space for replaceable files, ensuring adaptability to updates.

In this folder, you may encounter the following types of files:

* **Instance files**: These files contain input data or configurations necessary for your project's evaluation processes.

* **Baseline solution files**: Created by alternative algorithms, these files offer benchmark solutions that can be used for comparative analysis.

* **...**: Additional files as needed for your specific project.

By maintaining this organized folder structure, you can easily manage and replace external input files while keeping your project's evaluation processes streamlined and well-structured. This approach enhances the overall maintainability and scalability of your project.
