# Comparison of different initial samples

An important question is how the initial sample influences the results of the
optimization. In this folder, we compare the results of the optimization for
different initial samples. The initial samples are generated by the following
methods:

- YASA m=1 as this is our default
- YASA m=10 as the best method
- Incling as worst approach that was still able to compute a solution for most
  instances

You can change the selection in `_conf.py` by changing the `BASELINE_SELECTIONS`
variable.

We cannot use the samples from the previous experiments, as we want to run
SampLNS 15 minutes independent of the runtime for computing the initial sample.
The baseline algorithms are not in the focus of this experiment but only used to
generate the initial samples because just randomly making the samples worse
would not be a fair comparison (probably skewed and easily optimizable).
