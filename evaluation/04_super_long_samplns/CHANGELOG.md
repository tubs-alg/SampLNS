- _2023-08-21 (DK):_ Created experiment to analyze the behavior over even longer
  runtime. Also with a slightly updated CDS-algorithm. I am curious to see the
  convergence behavior of the CDS-part.

* _2023-08-25 (DK):_ As it turned out, samples by YASA can be invalid. Using
  FIDE-YASA instead. Rerunning all experiments. Using DATA folder for
  intermediate data.
