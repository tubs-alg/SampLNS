"""
This module provides instance representation and parser.
The instance representation will automatically perform simple transformations
such as converting binary AND/OR to n-ary.
Features and rules have different syntax.

```
from instance import parse
instance = parse("../instances/Automotive02/Automotive02_V1.xml")
