Preview License Disclaimer

This license.md file is provided as a preview of the forthcoming license terms
for the software code and related materials ("Code") contained in this
repository. The terms presented here are subject to change, and the final
licensing terms will be determined and outlined in a separate license agreement
that will be provided at a later date.

Please be aware that until the final license terms are established and
communicated, the Code contained in this repository is not permitted for free
use, distribution, or any form of public or private usage. Any use of the Code
without an officially established and agreed-upon license is prohibited.

It is essential to understand that the absence of a finalized license means that
you are not granted any rights or permissions to use the Code, except for the
purpose of reviewing and assessing its contents.

We are actively working to define the most appropriate licensing terms that will
accommodate different types of usage, including academic and commercial
applications. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this process.
Once the final license terms are in place, the license.md file will be updated
accordingly, and you will be required to adhere to the terms specified in the
official license agreement.

For questions or concerns related to the licensing of the Code, please contact
us at [krupke@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de]].
